                        <p>I'm interested in creating physical and digital systems to track our information streams and ultimately create 
                            biopersonalized algorithms by integrating physiological data. 
                            You can find some of my writing related to these topics.

                            Currently, I'm working on <a href="https://lifestack.ai"><b>Lifestack by DeMind Inc.</b></a> as a co-founder and head of product.

                            I'm a PhD dropout, who worked on various Human-Computer Interaction and Neurotechnology projects at Columbia University. Previously, I was an undergrad at the Unversity of Washington, exploring <a href="https://ubicomplab.cs.washington.edu/">Ubiquitous Computing</a>, <a href="https://neural.cs.washington.edu/">Neural
                            Engineering</a>, and Entrepreneurship. I am also a Neurotech enthusiast, previously led <a href="https://synaptechuw.org/">Synaptech</a> and wrote articles with <a href="https://www.neurotechjp.com/">NeurotechJP</a>.

                    My first post, <a href=writing/info-space.html><em>Personal Information Space</em></a>: 
                    a reflection on how to best contribute to information space, along with my thoughts on how 
                    personal information space will fit into our future.

                    My take on desktop <a href=writing/windows.html><em>Windows as Attention Streams</em></a>: 
                    thoughts on the desktop experience and taking a more intentional approach to workflows can 
                    further help us track our overall experience.
